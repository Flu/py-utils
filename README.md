# py-utils

Some utilities for use in command line written in python. I write them as I need them and update them when I can. Developed mainly to help me while attempting some courses, and I find it useful to use them every once in a while. 

## Instalation

If you would like to use them as well, just clone the repository to wherever. For every single utility, you can use ```--help``` to see what's up and how to use it. You know the drill.

Alternatively, you can also import them as modules and use the functions therein. I am gonna put a documentation with all the functions and all the wonders they can do.
